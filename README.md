This repository contains code for clustering analysis performed on a dataset. The analysis aims to group data points into distinct clusters based on their features. Here's a summary of the findings:

Cluster Sizes: The dataset has been clustered into three groups, with the following sizes:
Cluster 0: 74,912 data points
Cluster 1: 75,052 data points
Cluster 2: 100,036 data points
Cluster Centroids: Each cluster is represented by a centroid in the principal component space. The coordinates of these centroids are as follows:
Cluster 0 Centroid: (-1.54, -0.94)
Cluster 1 Centroid: (1.54, -0.93)
Cluster 2 Centroid: (-0.004, 1.41)
This analysis provides insights into the structure of the dataset and can aid in understanding the underlying patterns within the data.
